Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water. It generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product.

The process can be summarized by the following chemical equation:

6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. These energy-rich molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

This process is vital for life on Earth because it provides oxygen for breathing and forms the base of the food chain by supplying energy-rich organic compounds.
